Why I chose to do this game?
For this assignment I created a game that I myself would like to play. So I looked for inspiration in games that I would play
in my free time such as Everwing and Multi Level Car Parking 6. And I tried to join them together.

Game Description
In this game you are a car driving along a road. You must collect the coins that come down the screen to gain points. There
are also cherries that you can collect too. These cherries work as a power up and will clear the screen of all current bombs. 
You also get extra points when you collect the cherry power up. There is also a bomb that if you hit it will blow up and the 
game is over.
The start of the game opens with a small scene of a car drving by, once you hit a bomb in the game you are brought back to 
the same car screen but a bomb has now been placed in the path of the car. Once the car reaches the bomb the screen "blows up" 
and the game over screen is brought up.

Game Instructions
Once the opening scene has ended you must press the space bar to launch the game screen. 
Use your mouse to guide the car from left to right avoiding the bombs and collecting the coins/cherries.
